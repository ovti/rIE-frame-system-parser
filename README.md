# rIE Frame System with ETPR(k) Graph Grammar Parser

This repository contains a prototype system developed as part of a Master's thesis in Electronic Information Processing.

The goal of the project is to model a frame-based declarative knowledge system as an **interpreted graph (rIE)**.

----

## Project Structure

The system consists of two independent modules:

### Module 1 – Frame System Editor (C# / WPF)
- Desktop application built with **C# (.NET) ** and **WPF**.
- Allows creating and editing a frame based knowledge system.
- Frames are represented as graph nodes with attributes.
- Relations between frames are represented as edges.
- Provides visualisation of the frame system as a graph.
- Exports selected fragments of the system as an **rIE graph in JSON format**.

### Module 2
- later developed as a separate project

  - C#  
  - .NET 8  
  - MSAGL / GraphX (graph visualisation)
